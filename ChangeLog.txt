    awk "(\$4>=$min_read)||(\$8>=$min_read)" $output_dir/$sample/$sample.$chr.predSV.txt >> $output_dir/$sample/$sample.$chr.filter.predSV.txt
to

# $4 and $8 refer to the number of soft clips, not the coverage
# $14 and $15 refer to the percent identity of the left and right sides
Add to top of script
	min_id=$( cat $tool_info | grep -w '^STRUCT_MIN_INDENTITY' | cut -d '=' -f2)

#Purpose: Need to add CREST parameter to tool_info
STRUCT_MIN_INDENTITY=0.9

*** added a parameter -x 6 in novoalign script to allow more soft clipping reads
***

*** BUGS fixed

*** removed header from BAM when we split the bam to run somatic sniper
*** added paths to matlab and changed paramters in segseq to work
*** fixed the paramters for crest
*** scripts rading hard coded column number,, changed to read the header to figure out column number
*** scripts not working properly for exome, changed it to wrok for exome
*** statitical numbers were not correct
