### Version 1.1

1. Extract reads from the aligned BAM which are not used in calling variants, Workflow outputs a bam file with those reads.
(this way we don't have to store the original  aligned bam)
2. Replacing SSEQ (Seattle Seq annotation ) to SNPEFF and POLYPHEN2
3. Added 2 more somtic caller ; JOINT SNVMIX and MUTECT
4. Added scripts to merge single sample reports to get one big merge report for all the samples.
5. Onatarget calls are now in VCF format which can be used by users
6. Blat Column is added to the vcf and annoatated report. # of Alternate hits
7. ESP allele frequencies are added to the annotated report
8. To the filtered annotated report we add a column which comes from GATK which gives inforamtion about the impact of the variant.
9. Fixed minro bugs from previous version.
10. Fixed the issue with GATK variant annotator, which gives -ve QD value for non GATK vcf.
11. Added a script to add AD field to the somatic sniper vcf 
12. Switched to 1.6 version fo GATK
13. Switched to 1.67 version of PICARD
14. Switched to 1.19 version of Somatic sniper
15. Switched to dbsnp135 from dbsnp132
16. Added paired analysis for exomes too
17. Added one more module to start with vcf varint files to just annotate ontarget variant calls (exome ) : module is called as "ontarget"
18. Added variant module to paired analysis, user can start with realigned bam for pair.
